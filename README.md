# Fall 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge 

Please complete the following questions, and provide your thought process/work. You can attach your work in a text file, link, etc. on the application page. Please ensure answers are easily visible for reviewers!


**Question 1:**  On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30-day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.  

    - Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.  
      
        - What went wrong here was that there were a lot of outliers (values that were not within the range of the majority of values). 
          
        - A better way to evaluate this data is to remove the outliers first before attempting to get the mean (average) value, since the outliers would rarely occur in other situations.

    - What metric would you report for this dataset?
      
        - You can still get the mean for this dataset if you remove the outliers to get a more realistic average. However, if you did not want to remove any of the data from the dataset, you could also use median instead of mean, and it would be more accurate than the mean in this case.

    - What is its value?
      
        - By removing the outliers and then calculating the mean, the average value of orders is --> **$230.46**
          
        - Without removing the outliers and just going based on the median calculations the value is --> **$284.00**


**Question 2:** For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. [Follow this link](https://www.w3schools.com/SQL/TRYSQL.ASP?FILENAME=TRYSQL_SELECT_ALL) to access the data set required for the challenge. Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

1. How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?
   
    ```
    SELECT COUNT(O.ShipperID) as Speedy_Count
    FROM Orders AS O
        JOIN Shippers AS S ON O.ShipperID = S.ShipperID
    WHERE S.ShipperName = "Speedy Express";
   
    Output --> 54
    ```

2. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
   
    ```
     SELECT E.LastName,COUNT(E.EmployeeID) as Most_OrdersBy
     FROM Employees AS E
          JOIN Orders AS O ON O.EmployeeID = E.EmployeeID
     GROUP BY E.EmployeeID
     ORDER BY COUNT(E.EmployeeID) DESC
     LIMIT 1;
    
    Output --> Peacock
    ```

3. What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?
    
    ```
    SELECT prod.ProductName,SUM(details.Quantity) as MostOrderedProduct
    FROM Products AS prod
        JOIN OrderDetails AS details ON details.ProductID = prod.ProductID
        JOIN Orders AS ord ON ord.OrderID = details.OrderID
        JOIN Customers AS cust ON cust.CustomerID = ord.CustomerID
    WHERE cust.Country = "Germany"
    GROUP BY prod.ProductName
    ORDER BY SUM(details.Quantity) DESC
    LIMIT 1;
   
    Output --> Boston Crab Meat
    ```
